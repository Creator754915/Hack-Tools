object: Candidacy to join UNICEF mentors !

Dear UNICEF,
I’m writing this email to become a mentor of your charity.
My name is Gabriel, I’m 22 years old and I’m a student in my second year of Computer Science in the MIT higher education.
I hope to join UNICEF to share my qualities with children who come from slum areas and blighted areas.
I’m a very good speaker with people, especially with children, so if it’s needed I can come in contact with children. On top of that, I practice a lot of sports, it enables me to concentrate and to share my cheer mood with kids. I have already managed with kids as I used to work in a nursery for  2 years, so I know how to take care of children. I want to make these children smile, I want them to be self confident for at least 3 hours a week.
As what’s about my background, I come from a huge family farm in California. By and large on the farm I used to love running outside and speaking with the neighbors. According to my neighbors I’m a man with lots of energy to resell and an obliging man.
Thank you for reading this email.
I maintain a close eye on any interview opportunities with you.

Kind regards,

Gabriel Frances-Delgad
